n friends are playing passing the parcel game, where a parcel is passed between players. The player having the parcel at end of the time loses.
The friends are sitting in stright line and the parcel is initially contained by player 1. At every second the parcel gets passed to the next player i.e. 1->2->3...->n and when it reached to player n, it reverses its direction. i.e. the parcel travels from n->n-1->n-2...->1
Given number of players n and time t, determine who will lose the game.

friends = 4
time = 5
Output: 2
The batton will travel as:
1->2->3->4->3->2
Hence 2 will lose at end of 5th second.

Test Cases:
friends = 5
time = 3
Output: 4

friends = 3
time = 6
Output: 3

friends = 91289
time = 1
Output: 2

friends = 7216
time = 10632409207
Output: 4404

Solution:
def batonPass(friends, time):
    turns = time
    rem = time % (friends - 1)
    if turns % 2 == 1:
        if rem == 0:
            return friends
        return  friends-rem
    else:
        if rem == 0:
            return 1
        return rem+1

friends = int(input())
time = int(input())
print(batonPass(friends, time))
